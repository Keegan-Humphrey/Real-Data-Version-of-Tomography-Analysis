# Real-Data-Version-of-Tomography-Analysis

This directory includes code to localise low or high density regions in the ground using muon tomography.

To run the analysis, modify the directories in the view.py script to the location of the included detector data. This will generate a file with the preprocessed data.

Point the analyse.py script to this generated file to localise changes in density and visualise the result. 

The images that are produced by this analysis can be found in the /images/ directory, along with the locations of the objects where the data was taken.
